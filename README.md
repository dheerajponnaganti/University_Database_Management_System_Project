University Database Management System

A Java Application (JAR) which was designed as an Automated University Database Management System as part of our academic project in our junior year.
It was completed by a team of 4 students. It is a basic version, without complex code equipped with a simple user interface.
Dheeraj was instrumental in designing the User Interface. M Sai Madhur along with Vundela Lakshmi Charan Reddy and Naravula Hari Surya Vamsy worked for the backend database which comprised simple SQL queries. 
We believe this application could be updated in the future.
